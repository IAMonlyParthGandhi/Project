Todo App - Scope of Improvements and Known Bugs
Generated on: July 6, 2025

1. Backend Improvements
   - TypeScript Migration: Move server code from JavaScript to TypeScript for strong typing and IDE support.
   - Database Optimization:
     * Remove duplicate Mongoose indexes in models (e.g., userId+completed, dueDate, isArchived indexes).
   - API Enhancements:
     * Add versioning (e.g., /api/v1/)
     * Standardize response format across endpoints
     * Consider GraphQL for flexible data fetching
   - Performance Optimizations:
     * Use field projections in queries to limit returned fields
     * Introduce server-side caching where appropriate
   - Documentation:
     * Add JSDoc comments to functions and modules
     * Generate Swagger/OpenAPI specs for the REST API

2. Security Improvements
   - Eliminate Hardcoded Secrets:
     * Avoid fallback secrets in code (use environment validation)
   - Authentication Enhancements:
     * Implement refresh token rotation
     * Add CSRF protection on form submissions

3. Potential Bugs
   - Error Handling:
     * Inconsistent try/catch usage in async route handlers may mask errors
   - Socket.IO Authentication:
     * No logic to handle token expiration on active socket connections
   - Race Conditions:
     * Concurrent todo ordering logic may lead to inconsistent order values
   - Mongoose Deprecation:
     * Avoid deprecated document.remove(); use Model.pull() or update operators
   - Input Validation:
     * Some routes lack thorough request data validation

4. Feature Suggestions
   - Implement Planned Features:
     * Email notifications for due dates
     * Calendar integration
     * Team collaboration
     * File attachments
     * Two-factor authentication
   - Additional Ideas:
     * Recurring tasks
     * Task dependencies
     * Custom todo fields
     * Enhanced analytics dashboard
     * Kanban board UI
